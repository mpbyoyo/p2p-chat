# P2p-chat

P2p-chat is a nameless program I've been working on in my spare time to learn Golang using [Wails](https://wails.io/docs/introduction). The idea is to create a discord-like chat/video-call app with media sharing where individual users are fully responsible for the security of their information.
Instead of centralized servers run by a company, the goal here is to have easy-to-run locally hostable servers that can be shared with friends or communities, or to be able to connect directly to trusted friends via a peer-to-peer conneection.

This is still in very early development and is not at all functional. I'm still very much in the learning phase of Go, and so am taking my time trying to be sure I'm doing things right.
